 ## Halo Beauty — Shea Butter Skincare by Valentine

Welcome to Halo Beauty, a handcrafted front-end e-commerce experience designed to reflect the essence of natural beauty, wellness, and self-care. Built with pure HTML and CSS, this project showcases my understanding of front-end fundamentals and my growing interest in the intersection between code and commerce.

 Because beautiful skin deserves beautiful code.
